## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics
- Gender identity and expression, sexual orientation
- Level of experience, education, socio-economic status
- Religion, nationality, personal appearance, race

## Our Standards

### Examples of positive behavior:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Attempting collaboration before conflict
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Violence, threats of violence, or inciting self-harm
- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
- Trolling, spreading misinformation, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing private information without consent
- Abuse of the reporting process to harass others
- Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors

---

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:
- Clarifying acceptable behavior standards
- Taking fair corrective action in response to violations
- Removing, editing, or rejecting inappropriate contributions
- Banning contributors for harmful behavior

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- Project spaces (e.g., repositories, forums, etc.)
- Public spaces when representing the project (e.g., social media, events)

Representation includes using official project communication channels or acting as an appointed representative. Project maintainers may further define representation.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior can be reported anonymously through [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/chVYUnA4bP70WGsL2) or Directly to the project leadership. All complaints will be:
- Reviewed and investigated
- Addressed with necessary and appropriate responses
- Kept confidential to protect the reporter

Maintainers who fail to enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions as determined by the project leadership.

### Reporting Guidelines:
- If unsure whether an incident is a violation, report it anyway. Extra reports are better than unresolved incidents.
- Reports deemed non-violations help improve our Code of Conduct.
- Witness a dangerous situation? Report it, even as an observer.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

As this project focuses on task management, we encourage contributors to:
- Submit well-documented and organized code
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes
- Follow the existing coding style and conventions
- Update documentation for any changes made
